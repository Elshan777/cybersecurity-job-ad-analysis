Senior Software Engineer in Test, Talent Community Team at
Toptal


Position Description

Toptal is a quality-first company - we always strive to make the result
of top quality. In Toptal, quality is the responsibility of the whole
team led by the Software Engineers in Test. We believe that top quality
can only be reached by assuring this on multiple levels: product,
engineering, and their respective team.

We believe that QA is more about communication and collaboration rather
than documentation and processes and because of that, our Software
Engineers in Test are following a holistic approach. In reference to the
product, you will work closely with product managers to ensure the team
builds the proper software that reaches company goals and brings value
to its users. In reference to engineering, you will support fast and
reliable delivery of software, leading and coordinating software
assessment and testing activities. Last but not least, in your team, you
will lead process transformations to improve quality, mentoring your
teammates for better testing.

As a member of the Talent Community team, you will provide value to our
users, the freelancing professionals after they are accepted on our
talent network. The mission of the team is to keep our talents engaged
beyond hiring, help to connect with other talents that they can improve
their skills or career development, and learn about interesting clients.

This is a remote position that can be done from anywhere. Due to the
remote nature of this role, we are unable to provide visa sponsorship.
Resumes and communication must be submitted in English.
